### Courses at UNC

Here are a few examples of R and Programming courses/modules for biomedical researchers at UNC.

* Introduction to Data Analysis and Statistics with R ([GNET 743](https://gmb.unc.edu/files/2013/08/GNET_743_Spring_2013.pdf) and [here](http://gmb.unc.edu/gmb-students/student-resources/gnet-courses/))

* Introduction to Statistical Modeling ([BCB 720](http://bcb.unc.edu/files/2015/04/BCB720_Syllabus_2015.pdf) and [here](http://bcb.unc.edu/current-course-schedule/))

* UNIX and Perl for Biomedical Researchers ([GNET 742](https://www.med.unc.edu/oge/student-resources/files/GNET742_2014_syllabus.pdf) and [here](https://www.med.unc.edu/oge/student-resources/quantitative-skills-resources)). _These go over the important [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) environment and [Perl](https://www.perl.org) scripting, which you can use in conjunction with running R._

For more in-depth treatments of R, programming, and statistics, you might consider searching for courses offered through the Genetics Department (GNET), the Biostatistics Department (BIOS), the Computer Science Department (COMP), and/or the Statistics and Operations Research (STOR) Department at UNC. There is also a Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Certificate available at UNC, with details listed [here](http://bcb.unc.edu/certificate-requirements/).
