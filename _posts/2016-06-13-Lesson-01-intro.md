## Exploring R

### What is R?

R was developed in the 1990's by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka from the Statistics Department of the University of Auckland,  New Zealand, for use in statistical computing.[^r-contribs] 

Because it is free and [open-source][open-source], it has become a convenient and powerful tool for data science and statistical modeling in many academic research fields, in government, and in industry.

[open-source]: https://opensource.org/definition
[^r-contribs]: [https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)

### Evaluating R

R was developed to allow users to engage with it **interactively** as well as for users to **develop programs** and packages that can be added to the open source repositories, for anyone to use.

The idea was that it could be flexible enough to be useful for novices, who would use existing programs/packages and functions that R provides, as well as for software developers, who would create R packages for their own custom scientific and statistical applications.

| **Advantages**       					| **Disadvantages** |
| Open-Source					   	| Packages are of varying quality |
| Academic/professional community	| Very different from other standards [^standards] |
| High-quality visualization	 	| Less intuitive plotting |
| Multi-dimensional/large-scale data analysis	| Memory (RAM) use is not the best |
| Extensive documentation			| Overwhelming / disparate references |
| There are many ways to do the same thing | There are many ways to do the same thing |

> There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.

### A Word About Programming

If you think of programming essentially as part communication and part action, the following is a simplified way to think about what you are doing when you are coding.

**Process:**

1. Give Instructions (you, to the computer)

2. Perform Action (computer, usually hidden from you)

3. Present Output (computer, to you)

So, the fact that R is a program _and_ a **programming** language means that you can customize the instructions you give to R, as well as the actions (or combinations of actions) that are available to you, enabling large-scale and repetitive/reproducible analyses that are specific to your needs.

#### Coding Requires Precise Instructions [^gigo]

[^gigo]: Another take on this principle is Garbage In, Garbage out. See [this site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out). Even so, R is unlike many other languages in that there are often many sets of instructions that can be issued to produce the same or similar output.

As with any programming language, precision in coding is critical, and beyond what we expect in a normal conversation with other people. For example, a parent could issue an instruction to his/her child: "**Go to bed**".  This seems like a complete enough set of instructions for the child to understand.

However, if the parent issued this instruction to their computer (or their robot child), the computer might ask:

* "**Who** is instructing me?"
* "**Where** should I go to bed?"
* "**When** should I go to bed?", etc.

To satisfy the robot child, perhaps "I, your parent, am asking you to **go to bed** in your room, now" is a better set of instructions. 

I.e., if you are on a Linux or Mac, and you try to tell your computer to ```shutdown``` via the command line, it likely wants to know:

* **Who** is asking it to shutdown (the superuser, i.e. someone with authority who knows a password)
* **How** it should shutdown (halt, reboot, etc.), and
* **When** it should shutdown (usually "now").

If you are imprecise with your **instructions**, and simply type ```shutdown``` you get no **action** and no **output** or result.[^noterror]

[^noterror]:  (aside from any error or warning messages.)

If you get the **instructions** precisely right, then the computer's **actions** will precisely follow your instructions, and the **output**, in this case, will be that the machine is powered off. [^defaults]  

We will run into this scenario with R over and over, and we hope to help you learn to troubleshoot any problems you might have communicating with R.

[^defaults]: Sometimes, programmers will provide **defaults** in the functions that they write. This means that if the user does not give all the details (who, what, where, when, how, etc.) when sending instructions to the function, there are stored instructions that the function will use. This can be helpful to the user, simplifying the use of the function, but it is also dangerous if the user is unfamiliar with what the defaults are.

---

At this point, let's start talking about how we can use R for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing our data. Please start RStudio from your Applications/Programs folder. We will explore 4 aspects of R:

* R as a Scientific Calculator
* R as a Tool for Statistical Analysis
* R as a Tool for High Quality Plots
* R as a Tool for Reproducible Research


---

### R is a Scientific Calculator

You can follow along by starting in the lower left-hand corner of your RStudio session. This is the **console**, where you can code _interactively_. I encourage you to type interactively, rather than copy and paste the commands.
  
```
> 1+1
```

The sideways carat, `>`, indicates the beginning of a line where you have entered some code, in this case an _operation_, or set of **instructions**. You should not type the `>` yourself.

After you are done typing, press enter, and below your **instructions** should be the **output**. You can ignore the ```[1]``` for now (it will make sense later), and just look at what follows.

```
[1] 2
```

Internally, R is doing some sort of **action**, using 0's and 1's, to produce output from your instructions.

Let's try something else:

```
> 5*3
[1] 15
```

Although there are stylistic conventions with spacing, you'll notice that R does not care if you type `5*3` or `5 * 3` -- it will output the same result either way.

Many other basic operations are available:[^log]

[^log]: Note that the ```log()``` function defaults to _natural_ log, a.k.a. "ln", or ```log(..., base=exp(1))```. You might mistake it for ```log10```, or ```log(..., base=10)```.


```
> 4/3
[1] 1.333333

> 10^2
[1] 100

> 10e2
[1] 1000

> log(1)
[1] 0
```

The second to last line is a sort of special case, where a letter acts as an operator. We can ignore this for now, but keep in mind that sometimes a single letter means something to R that you might not expect.

That last line of instructions uses an operator with parentheses, which indicates that you are using a **function**. [^function] Functions can often take more than one **argument** in between the parentheses. These change what input the function gets, what the function does, and/or what it communicates with you. We will talk more about these later.

Sometimes, you will get output where R has chosen to represent a numeric value using letters. This is an example of a **reserved word** in R:

```
> log(0)
[1] -Inf
```

In this case, you can do some simple operations using `Inf` yourself.

```
> Inf+Inf
[1] Inf
> Inf/0
[Inf]
> 1/Inf
0
```

[^function]: We will discuss functions and what you put inside the parentheses later. Parentheses can also be used to group operations together (i.e. PEMDAS).

Sometimes the instruction you give does not make sense to ```R```.

```
> log(-1)
[1] NaN
Warning message:
In log(-1) : NaNs produced
```

See that we have received output, ```[1] NaN```, as well a warning message below it describing the situation. When something goes wrong in R, it will give you a **warning**, or an **error** which is more "severe." [^segfault] We will go over **troubleshooting** these warnings and errors later.

Regarding `NaN`, R help says "These apply to numeric values and real and imaginary parts of complex values but not to values of integer vectors". Or, more simply, `NaN = Not a Number.`


[^segfault]: And hopefully not too many **segfaults** -- segmentation faults, which would cause the program to fail or **crash**.

```
> Inf - Inf
[1] NaN
```

In this case, `NaN` means "undefined", but you don't get a warning message. Keep in mind that you can get errors, or unexpected/unintended output, _without_ warning or error messages, so we will try to introduce you to some good coding practices such as **error checking** or **sanity checking** later on in the course.

Some basic operations are listed at this [website][r-operations], and you can view this [video][r-operations-video], in order to learn to use **R** to do basic calculations in your day-to-day work.

[r-operations]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html
[r-operations-video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLqzoL9-eJTNBDdKgJgJzaQcY6OXmsXAHU&v=UYclmg1_KLk

Try to use some of these on your own, providing your own input: `log2(), log10(), exp(), sqrt(), exp(), abs()`.

Did you get the results you would expect? Did you get any errors or warnings?

---

Now, suppose you want to define a letter or a word to represent a number or other type of **object** (such as a string of letters, a function, etc.), so that you can easily refer to the object without typing it again and again. Let's call this a **variable**.

You can **assign** the object to the letter or word using the ```<-``` operation, which looks like a left-facing arrow.

It works like this: **variable <- object**

We will be doing a whole lot of this, but we will introduce it very quickly here. Start by creating a variable named ```myvar```, and assign a value to it:

```
> myvar <- 25
```

Now, when you type ```myvar``` into the console, it gives you output corresponding to the value you assigned to it:

```
> myvar
[1] 25
```

It is conventional to make assignments in this direction, assigning an object on the right to a variable on the left. It is uncommon to go the other direction in R, however, you can assign from left to right: **object -> variable**. 

In R, it is also preferred to use the assignment operator instead of the more intuitive equals sign: `myvar = 25`. We will talk about when you should use the equals sign later, especially in functions, and in logic, as `==`.

Variables are convenient and critical in programming with R. Suppose you wanted to ask what the value of $25x25$ is, you could type:

```
> myvar * myvar
[1] 625
```
or

```
> myvar^2
[1] 625
```

You can then assign that set of instructions, itself, to a new variable, ```myvar1```:

```
> myvar1 <- myvar^2
> myvar1
[1] 625
```

Let's try that with a **string**:

```
> mystring <- "twenty five times twenty five is six hundred twenty five"
> mystring
[1] "twenty five times twenty five is six hundred twenty five"
> mystring <- 'this is also a string'
> mystring
[1] "this is also a string"
```

By enclosing words or letters in quotes (single or double), we can assign them to the variable just like we did with the numbers and operations.

While this might not appear to be applicable to scientific calculation, you will likely do a decent amount of string manipulation in R. There are strings in your data tables ("Male", "Female", "Treated", "Control") and in your genomic sequences ("ATG CGC AAT CCT"), and we will go over how you can learn to chop them up and parse them when needed.

Finally, there are times you will want to put words in your code that you would like R to ignore or _not_ evaluate, and we will talk more about those below (i.e. commenting your code).

### R is a Tool for Statistical Analysis

This is a good time to introduce an R cheat sheet, [here](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf). The second page summarizes some statistical distributions.

More on this in Lecture 5.

---

### R is a Tool for High-Quality Plots 

Let's try to plot some of these distributions.

More on this in Lecture 3.

---

### R is a Tool for Reproducible Research

You can think of **commenting** your code as similar to keeping a good laboratory notebook. You should comment your code so that you understand what the code means when you come back to it months later, and/or so that someone else can follow along with what did, if they ever try to reproduce your analysis. Comments can be useful when you are using R interactively, especially if you save your R history in a file, but you will probably comment your code much more when you are writing R **scripts**.

## Getting Around in R

We will go over some of these in class, interactively:

```
ls()
rm()

search()
environment()
help()

list.files()
getwd()
setwd()

subset()
c()

q() # ctrl + D on the command line
```

## Packages

To find packages for R, there are several places you can look:

1. CRAN
2. GitHub
3. Bioconductor

Sometimes, websites, books, or journal articles will have details about an R package you may be interested in using. One good, peer-reviewed, open access resource is [_The R Journal_](https://journal.r-project.org).

## Review

Look I will try to update this section after class to include a summary of the topics discussed and to cover the questions raised during class.


> One of the things I really like about programming languages is that it's the perfect excuse to stick your nose into any field. So if you're interested in high energy physics and the structure of the universe, being a programmer is one of the best ways to get in there. It's probably easier than becoming a theoretical physicist.
