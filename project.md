## Instructions for Course Project for Introduction to R

1. Choose an organism of interest from the list of available releases at UCSC: [UCSC Genome Releases](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQreleases.html#release1).
2. Download genomic information of interest from the following website, as a *.tsv file(s): [UCSC Table Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). 
We will go over a specific example of this in class.
3. Decide on a question of interest which can be explored using the data set.
4. Use R to analyze the data set using the methods you have learned (or methods you have discovered through online/book searches), and answer the question of interest.
	* Be creative. You can use statistical tests and modeling, or you can report qualitative findings based on exploratory analysis.
	* Generate and save at least one plot representing the data you are analyzing.
	* Save code as *.R file. Optional: ask classmate to reproduce analysis from your code.
6. Answer your question. Report findings in a five-minute slideshow presentation. Try to include:
	* Question or hypothesis of interest
	* Outline of methods used for analyzing data
	* Plot of results
	* Discussion

All members of the HtLtC 2016 Summer Series will present their final projects on **Thursday, August 4th, 2016**.
